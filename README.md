# Movie Trailer website
First project of Udacity Full Stack Nano Degree

##Purpose
To be able to display a list of movies and their information.

##How to use
1. You will have to modify the `movies` array that holds multiple `Movie` classes.
  * The `movie` class require four pieces information
    + A title
    + A biography
    + A poster URL for the movie
    + A YouTube trailer
    
    That have to be passed through the constructor of the `Movie` class
    
2. Once you have all your movies in the `movies` array you have to run the `fresh_tomatoes.py` script. 
   * Which will create the HTML built from the `movies` array. 
   * Then it will open a browser with the HTML that it built
      
3. To see the movie's trailer you have to click on the movie's poster.
